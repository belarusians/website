While working, you discovered something. Also, I taught you a little. Present these insights to me.

## What to Capture

### 1. Lessons Learned → CLAUDE.md

Patterns, gotchas, or conventions worth remembering **permanently**:

- Type safety patterns
- Project-specific conventions
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Non-obvious behaviors

Skip temporary knowledge: one-time migration steps, version-specific workarounds, transient dependency issues, or anything that stops being relevant once a task is complete.

Add to the "Lessons Learned" section if valuable.

### 2. Path-Filtered Rules → `.claude/rules/`

If we worked extensively in a subdirectory that has (or should have) its own documentation:

- Consider creating a rule file that loads relevant context when touching those files

Ask me before creating new rules.

## Output

1. List insights discovered during the session
2. Propose which ones deserve to be persisted (and where)
3. Wait for my approval before writing anything
